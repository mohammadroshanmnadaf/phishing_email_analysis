1.Sender‚Äôs Email Address (Spoofing Check)
  Displayed sender: it-support@mastercard.com
  Potential issue: Attackers can spoof a trusted display name or use similar-looking domains (mastercard-secure.com, mastercard.com).

2.Header Analysis
  Used mxtoolbox email analyzer.
  Email Subject: Action Required: Important Security Update for Your Mastercard Account  
  Received Delay: 0 seconds  
  
  Headers Found
  Header Name	Header Value
  From	        it-support@mastercard.com
  To	        employee@email.com
  Subject	    Action Required: Important Security Update for Your Mastercard Account
  SPF/DKIM/DMARC status not confirmed: The analyzer suggests setting up DMARC, which means this message may not have passed DMARC checks.

3.Suspicious Links or Attachments:
  Text link: ‚Äúüëâ Reset your Mastercard Password‚Äù
  Hover preview: Could point to a non-Mastercard domain ,which is a classic phishing technique.

4.Urgent or Threatening Language
  "Your account access will be temporarily suspended if you do not complete this update by the end of the business day".
  This wil create a panic and force to take quick actions without verifying.

5.Branding Misuse / Social Engineering:
  Uses official Mastercard branding, IT policy references (‚ÄúISO 27001, GDPR‚Äù) to look legitimate.
  Legitimate companies rarely ask for password resets via external links.
